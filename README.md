 Hand-controlled-wheelchair-
A hand-controlled wheelchair using an ESP32 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor for individuals with mobility challenges. This system leverages the ESP32's processing power and wireless capabilities, along with the MPU6050's motion tracking (accelerometer and gyroscope), to create a responsive and intuitive control mechanism for the wheelchair.
